/*Write an abstract class Student that includes the following hidden attributes: id(int),
name(String), major(String) and grade(double), then create setters and getters for them.
Write two classes that inherited from Student: ItStudent and ArtStudent. The grade for
ItStudent is calculated as: grade = mid*0.30 + project*0.30 + final*0.40 and the grade for
ArtStudent is calculated as: grade = mid*0.40 + report*0.10 + final*0.50. Crate main class
that achieve the following:
a. Declare and initialize an array of five Student objects from both ItStudent and ArtStudent
classes.
b. Sort the Student objects by grade in descending order using functions.
c. Save the sorted objects into text file.*/
